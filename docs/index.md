# AT-TPC Monte Carlo Simulation Engine

attpc_engine is a Monte Carlo simulation engine designed for use with AT-TPC data and analysis. In particular, attpc_engine is highly compatible with the [Spyral](https://github.com/ATTPC/Spyral) analysis library, being able to provide an output which can be injected into that analysis pipeline. attpc_engine seeks to provide a detailed simulation framework without compromising on a core goal of being fast enough to not hinder productivity.
